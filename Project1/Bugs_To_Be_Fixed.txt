========== Bugs ===========

1.The error message format is not right. [Status: Fixed]

The format for ANY error message is the following:
ERROR: [error message]

Currently, the main class wc, when the argument is wrong, the following message is printed:
Usage: java wc [-ld] [file]
No arguments given

Insteady, the following error message should be proper:
ERROR: No arguments given, 
Usage: java wc [-ld] [file]


2.getAverageSentenceLength() doesn't return the correct number [Status: Fixed]
For example, I added a simple2.txt file.
The correct output obviously should be 2.00, because there are 2 words and 1 sentence, but now the output is 0.0


3.The output format is not correct [Status: Fixed]

The format of wc output should be a double rounded to 2 decimal point, but now it is not. 

4.The default word length issue [Status: Fixed]

The default word length should be 4, because this number is inclusive meaning word with length 3 or less are not counted.
