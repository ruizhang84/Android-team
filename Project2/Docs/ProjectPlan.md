# Project Plan

**Author**: 6300Spring16Team54 

## 1 Introduction
The Project "TCCart" aims at developing a payment and rewards management system for carts that sells tea/coffee and runs on Android platform.

The Android app ‘TCCart’ is a simple and user-friendly payment and rewards management system for tea and coffee carts, with a clean user interface that enables the TC Cart Manager to conveniently, add customers,print customer cards,edit customer information, process purchases, keep track of purchases and rewards .  The app has multiple advantages such as easy-to-use User interface with stunning design and it let's the manager to get Customer details such as Purchases & Rewards on a tap. Another great feature of this app is it prints Customer card immediately when any new Customer is added to the System.
 


## 2 Process Description

***2.1 Project Life Cycle***

We have adopted  Waterfall model for our software development process. The life cycles of this project include Requirements Gathering and Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing and Maintenance.

***2.2.1 Requirements Gathering and Analysis:***

In this phase all possible requirements of the system to be developed are base lined and presented to the Client with the help of UML(Unified Modeling Language) class diagram along with an understanding document.

*Activities Performed:*

 The software development team, at first created UML Class diagrams individually in order to understand the requirements thoroughly. 
        Project plan created is used to guide both project execution and project control.

*Entry Criteria:*

 Understand the requirements thoroughly by doing brainstorming and
   analyzing the requirements to identify and refine (1) classes, (2)   
   attributes, (3) operations, and (4) relationships. Perform
   requirements feasibility analysis to ensure that the requirements are
   testable or not.

Exit Criteria:

- UML Class Diagram describing the System Design
- Project Plan

***2.2.2 System Design***

*Activities Performed:*

In this phase the architecture of the system to be developed is designed as per the requirements specified and is documented. Define a series of components such as screens/interfaces/modules or other systems and how they interact with each other. Hardware and Software requirements of the system are specified for each of the screens.

The Software Development Team had a discussion on the System requirements , analyzed the Class diagrams created by each individual in the team and came up with a single UML Class diagram which best describes the System Design to be presented to the Client.

Also the team created a Use case diagram that perfectly describes the Actors,Use cases,System and relationship between them.

*Entry Criteria:*

 - Requirements Specification Document
 -    Individual UML Class diagrams created by the individual team members.

*Exit Criteria:*

- UML Class diagram that best describes the System Design.
- Design Document
- Vision Document
- Use Case Model
- Test Plan without results

***2.2.3 Implementation***

Source code is implemented during this phase as per the design specified in the UML diagram.  Unit testing is performed to test individual pieces of code and to verify whether individual modules are doing what they are intended to do.Traceability matrix has been created to keep track if the requirements are being met.
 
*Entry Criteria:*

- UML Class diagram that best describes the System Design.
- Design Document
-  Use Case Model
- Test Plan without results


*Exit Criteria:*

  - Initial version of the app
  - Unit test cases and results
  - Test Plan with partial results
  - User Manual

***2.2.4 System Testing***

Perform Integration testing by putting together all the modules that have been developed and tested individually to make sure it works as expected. Perform functional and non-functional testing to make sure that the system meets the requirements. Report issues in case of anomalies by logging the defect and tracking it to closure. Progress on testing can be tracked via tools like traceability metrics, ALM.

*Entry Criteria:*

   - Unit tested code and test cases

*Exit Criteria:*

  - Test cases
  - Test reports
  - Defect reports and 
  - Updated matrices.

***2.2.5 System Deployment***

During this phase make sure that the final version of the app is ready with all the exit criteria met and  no open Severity 1 issues. Ensure that the environment is up and running. Deploy the application in the respective environment; perform a sanity check in the environment after the application is deployed to ensure the application does not break.

*Entry Criteria:*

  - Final version of the Android app with no outstanding issues

*Exit Criteria:*

- User Manual and environment definition / specification
- Test plan with final results.

***2.2.6 System Maintenance***

Make sure that the application is up and running in the respective environment. If the user encounters any defect, make sure to note and fix the issues faced. In case any issue is fixed; the updated code is deployed in the environment and regression testing is performed to ensure the existing functionality is not changed.

*Entry Criteria:*

- User Manual

*Exit Criteria:*

 - List of production tickets
 -  List of new features implemented.
