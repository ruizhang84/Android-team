## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

*This section should provide details about your unit-, integration-, system-, and regression-testing strategies. In particular, it should discuss which activities you will perform as part of your testing process, and who will perform such activities.*

Our testing strategy will be comprehensive in nature as in order to assure as few defects as possible across a team project with a shortened timeframe - testing will be critical.  

**Unit Test Cases**  
Each individual will write their own unit test cases for the methods they author and verify passing unit test cases before a commit is done once a feature has been implemented.  Most of the time, unit test cases will be run more often.

**Integration & System Test Cases**  
As of now, I am unclear as to whether or not we would dilineate between integration and system test cases for such a small project.  Testing the interaction of multiple units is still critical and we will automate them using Barista / Espresso and/or run them manually on an android emulator.  Test cases will be written by the whole team, driven by the test lead, and executed by everyone.

### 1.2 Test Selection

*Here you should discuss how you are going to select your test cases, that is, which black-box and/or white-box techniques you will use. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

Test cases will be selected using a combination of extreme testing (testing the far ends of input, for example) as well as common use cases.  This should allow us to make sure core functionality works while hitting the outliers for corner case issues.

We will be using a mix of black-box and white-box testing given that individuals will both write/run test cases for their own code as well as for code that they have not authored.  However, I expect unit test cases to be more white box driven than the others.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

*Define how you are going to assess the quality of your test cases. Typically, this involves some form of functional or structural coverage. If you plan to use different techniques at different testing levels (e.g., unit and system), you should clarify that.*

To be determined!

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

*Describe how bugs and enhancement requests will be tracked.*

To be determined!

### 1.5 Technology

*Describe any testing technology you intend to use or build (e.g., JUnit, Selenium).*

At a minimum, JUnit.

## 2 Test Cases

*This section should be the core of this document. You should provide a table of test cases, one per row. For each test case, the table should provide its purpose, the steps necessary to perform the test, the expected result, the actual result (to be filled later), pass/fail information (to be filled later), and any additional information you think is relevant.*
